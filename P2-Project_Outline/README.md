# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a media list tracking tool that will allow users to track anime (but could be applied to any media: shows, movies, books, etc.) by a variety of qualifiers. Users will be able to create an account, log in, create, edit, sort, filter, rate, and remove media from a variety of lists that sort the anime into categories (watched, want to watch, rewatching, favorites, etc.). Based on user ratings recommendations of new media the user may enjoy should be able to be made.

I decided to make this project because my wife is a fervent anime watcher and has not found an anime list tool available to her that has all of the features that she would like it to have. The goal is to make an application that could then be easily modified to track any form of media, not just anime or tv shows, and to make it easily accessible both on typical computers and handheld devices.

### Features
- User Signup: Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to keep track of the anime (or any other media) that they would like to consume.
- User Login: Users will be able to log in after creating a profile. Passwords need to be hashed, salted, etc.
- Create, Edit, Rate, and Remove Media: Users will be able to create items to put on their lists and rate them.
- Sort, Filter, and Search Lists: Users will be able to sort, filter, and search their lists for easier parsing. 
- Recommend new media via ratings information: Using user reviews and categorizations, users will receive recommendations about media they may like.

### Technologies
- Python? Probably Python
- Flask?
- MySQL?

### What I'll Have to Learn
While I have created an incredibly basic list program in LC101 this project will be built from scratch and will be much larger in scale and scope. It will require HTTP requests and responses, serving up templates, and connecting to a database, all of which I am at least somewhat familiar with. However, to truly accomplish what I envision I will need to likely need to learn about webscraping (to fill a database with an initial list of anime and ratings), and presenting the application properly on a variety of screen sizes. Further, I would love to learn enough to actually present this in true "app" form. Something that could be downloaded onto a phone rather than just through a webpage, though that may be beyond the scope of the 8 week course.
